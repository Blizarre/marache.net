There were several bugs still present in this app, mostly under the new versions of Android.

I started a new project on Android, so I took some times to make this app more resilient to errors, and to do some extensive testing for KitKat.

The application is available on the [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smfandroid.smsbeacon), and the source code is on [Github](https://github.com/Blizarre/SMSBeacon).
