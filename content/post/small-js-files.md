I needed a robust counter for my work, but none of thoses I found were good enough. So I made mine ! The features list is small, and the interface is primitive, but it works. I needed mostly a way to get the exact time of every action, the time elapsed since the last action, since the beginning, and a spreadsheet-friendly output format. 

And because it is always useful, there's a programmer-friendly converter too.

 - [Hex/Dec/Octal Converter](projects/jscripts/converter.html)

The repository is on [Github](https://github.com/Blizarre/jscripts).
