I am currently working on four softwares, at various stage of completion:

* SleekTodo, a simple Todo manager. Already on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smfandroid.sleektodo), [Sources](https://github.com/Blizarre/SleekTODO).
* Lost'n'Phoned : A tool to help find your lost phone. Published on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smfandroid.smsbeacon), [Source](https://github.com/Blizarre/SMSBeacon).
* Game100 : A simple number game, not enough polish, even if it works quite well ! [Source](https://github.com/NounoursRobotter/Game100).
