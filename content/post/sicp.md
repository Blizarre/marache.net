I have always been intrigued by the LISP family of languages, partly because of the "code is data" philosophy, and partly 
because of the simple syntax. I read recently a lot of praise for a book used at the MIT to introduce programming using 
Scheme (a LISP dialect): [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/). This book is apparently best enjoyed by experienced 
programmers who want to go deeper into the basics of programming.

I have downloaded an ebook version of this book and will give it a try !
