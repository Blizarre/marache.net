I have always been intrigued by the LISP family of languages, partly because of the "code is data" philosophy, and partly because of the simple syntax. I read recently a lot of praise for a book used at the MIT to introduce programming using 
Scheme (a LISP dialect): [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/). This book is apparently best enjoyed by experienced programmers who want to go deeper into the basics of programming.

I have downloaded an ebook version of this book and will give it a try. I don't really expect to have enough available time to 
be able to go very far, but the first chapter provides a different and interesting way to see programming through the functional approach. The language used (scheme) looks very clean.
