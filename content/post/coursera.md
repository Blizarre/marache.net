I just discovered that coursera had several courses about Scala, made by the creator of the language Martin Odersky.

* Functional programming: https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun
* Reactive programming: https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive

I always wanted to try functional programming, and they seem to be a good place to start. I probably won't have enough time to follow them through, but I started a small fractal generator in scala, using what I learned in the first few videos, and I start to really like the language.
